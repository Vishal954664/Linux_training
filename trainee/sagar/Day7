Linux mount:- mount command is used to mount the filesystem found on a device to big tree structure(Linux filesystem) rooted at ‘/‘. Conversely,
          another command umount can be used to detach these devices from the Tree.
          All files accessible in Unix, or a Unix-style system such as Linux, are arranged in one big tree: 
          the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command attaches a filesystem, located on some device or other, to the file tree. Conversely, the umount command will detach it again.

          syntax:- mount -t type device dir
          

umount:- 








fstab:- The fstab (or file systems table) file is a system configuration file commonly found at /etc/fstab on Unix and Unix-like computer systems.
