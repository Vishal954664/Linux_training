## All about git And day 1


Git is a version control system. 
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.
 
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.


Version Control System- a 
Version Control System tracks the history of changes as people and team collaborate on project together.

using vcs we access the:
1. which changes are made?
2. who made the changes?
3. when where changes the made?
4. Why were changes needed?


Git commands:-
git init- initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.
git clone-  creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. 
git push- updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
git pull- updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. 
git merge- merges lines of development together.
git branch- shows the branches being worked on locally.
git status- shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
git commit- saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.
git add- the git add command adds a change in the working directory of the staging Area.



Q- Is git and github same?
While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.






Directory tree:- A tree or tree directory structure is a hierarchical data structure that organizes data elements, called nodes, by connecting them with links, called branches. This structure is used to help display large amounts of information in an easy to read format.

Linux Directory Structure:-
1. / – The Root Directory
2. /bin – Essential User Binaries
3. /boot – Static Boot Files
4. /cdrom – Historical Mount Point for CD-ROMs
5. /dev – Device Files
6. /etc – Configuration Files
7. /home – Home Folders
8. /lib – Essential Shared Libraries
9. /lost+found – Recovered Files
10. /opt – Optional Packages
11. /proc – Kernel & Process Files
12. /root – Root Home Directory
13. /run – Application State Files
14. /sbin – System Administration Binaries
15. /srv – Service Data
16. /tmp – Temporary Files
17. /usr – User Binaries & Read-Only Data
18. /var – Variable Data Files
