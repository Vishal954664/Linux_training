LINUX:-
	Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.
			An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with desktop or laptop.


The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:
    1. Bootloader –  The software that manages the boot process of your computer. F
    2. Kernel – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called ?Linux?. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS. 
    3. Init system – This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is systemd? which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader). 
    4. Daemons – These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop. 
    5. Graphical server – This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X. 


Shells in linux:- 
The shell is the command interpretor in an operating system such as Unix or GNU/Linux, it is a program that executes other programs. It provides a computer user an interface to the Unix/GNU Linux system so that the user can run different commands or utilities/tools with some input data.

Different Types of Shells in Linux
1. The Bourne Shell(sh)- D
2.- The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
3. The Korn Shell (ksh)
4. The Korn Shell (ksh)
5. The Z Shell (zsh)

Bash In linux- Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ' Bourne-Again SHell ', a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh , which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.
Basic Commands:-
* pwd- when yoy first open the terminal you are in the first directory of the user.
* ls — Use the "ls" command to know what files are in the directory you are in. we can see all the hidden files by using the command “ls -a”.
* cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory.
* cat – use the cat command to display the content of a file.
* mkdir- to create a folder or a directory
* rmdir- Use rmdir to delete a directory.
* rm- Use the rm command to delete files and directories.
		 Use "rm -r" to delete just the directory.
* touch — The touch command is used to create a file.
* man & --help — To know more about a command and how to use it, use the man command.
* cp — Use the cp command to copy files through the command line.
* mv — Use the mv command to move files through the command line.








Directory Tree:-
A directory tree is a hierarchy of directories that consists of a single directory, called the parent directory or top level directory, and all levels of its subdirectories.
 Unix-like operating systems feature a single root directory from which all other directory trees emanate.

Directory Structure- A tree or tree directory structure is a hierarchical data structure that organizes data elements, called nodes, by connecting them with links, called branches. This structure is used to help display large amounts of information in an easy to read format.
Major Directory Tree-  it is like a tree. The base of the linux file system heirarchy begins at the root. Directories branch off the root, but everything start at root.
The Linux Directory Structure 
    • / – The Root Directory. Everything on your Linux system is located under the / directory, known as the root directory. 
    • /bin – Essential User Binaries.
    • /sbin- system binaries.
    • Proc- process information  
    • /boot – Static Boot Files. 
    • /cdrom – Historical Mount Point for CD-ROMs. 
    • /dev – Device Files. 
    • /etc – Configuration Files. 
    • /home – Home Folders. 
    • /lib – Essential Shared Libraries.
    • /usr – user program
    • /home – home directories
    • /opt – optional add on apps
