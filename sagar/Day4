User management:- User management includes everything from creating a user to deleting a user on our system. Graphical tools are easy and suitable for new users, as it makes sure you'll not run into any trouble. ... Command line tools includes commands like useradd, userdel, passwd, etc.

	Normally Linux/Unix based systems have two user accounts; a general user account, and the root account, which is the super user that can access everything on the machine, make system changes, and administer other users.

In a single directory, we can create 60,000 users. Now we will discuss the important commands to manage users in Linux.

**commands:-
Add a user:  	sudo adduser username
disable a user: sudo passwd-l 'username'
delete a user:-  sudo userdl-r 'username'


add user to a user group - sudo usermod -a-G GROUPNAME USERNAME

remove user from a user group - sudo deluser USER GROUPNAME

gives information on all logged in user - finger

gives information of a particular user - finger username

**Creating a user:- in linux, every user is assigned an individual which contains all the files, information and data of the user.

using terminal:-
 		step1.- use command sudo user :-   $sudo adduser newusersagar
		
		step2. enter password for the new account
		
		step3. enter details of the user and press Y
		
**Deleting disabling account:- for disabling an account using terminal, remove the password set on the account.
		sudo passwd -l 'newusersagar'
		
		
**group add- sudo groupadd binod
		to check groups:- cat/etc/group/grep binod
		

**group delete:- sudo groupdel binod

**user check:- awk-f:'{print $1}'/etc/passwd

**user change- su-l sagar
		to check:- whoami
**to delete an account:- sudo userdel -r 'newusersagar'

1. To list out all the users in Linux, use the awk command with -F option. Here, we are accessing a file and printing only first colum with the help of print $1 and awk.
awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd

2. Using id command, you can get the ID of any username. Every user has an id assigned to it and the user is identified with the help of this id. By default, this id is also the group id of the user.
id username

3. The command to add a user. useradd command adds a new user to the directory.
	Command:-  sudo useradd username

4. Using passwd command to assign a password to a user. After using this command we have to enter the new password for the user and then the password gets updated to the new password.
	Command:- passwd username
	Example: passwd sagar

5. Accessing a user configuration file. This commands prints the data of the configuration file. This file contains information about the user in the format.
	cat /etc/passwd
	username : x : user id : user group id : :
6. The command to change the user ID for a user.:- This command can change the user ID of a user. The user with the given username will be assigned with the new ID given in the command and the old ID will be removed.
	usermod  -u new_id username

7. Command to Modify the group ID of a user.:- This command can change the group ID of a user and hence it can even be used to move a user to an already existing group.
	usermod -g  new_group_id username
Example: sagar usermod -g 1005 test

8. change the user login name using usermod command. The below command is used to change the login name of the user. The old login name of the user is changed to the new login name provided.
sudo usermod -l new_login_name old_login_name
Example: sagar usermod -c vishal 



9. delete a user name. The below command deletes the user whose username is provided. Make sure that the user is not part of a group. If the user is part of a group then it will not be deleted directly, hence we will have to first remove him from the group and then we can delete him.
userdel -r username
Example: sagar userdel -r vishal
